  <p>Who is it that would loan Allah a goodly so He may multiply for him mamy times over?(<cite>Surat-Baqara, Verse 245</cite>)</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>It should be noted that Allah who is in need of no one and nothing,instills upon his men to give Qarz-e-hasana because it is in men's furgal whilst spending his wealth.Allah speaks about Qraz because it is returned and Allah promises that he will returned goodly loan by 70 flods.
      Allah conveys hus message to the Muslim ummah througt the Holy Propher Muhammad prompting muslims to spend their wealth in a certain way.He says,Oh childerns of Adam!Trust me with your wealth.if you do so,no fire,flood or thieves will able to rob you of your money.Instead,you
      will be endowed eith your wealth when you most need it.he futher says poor and weak will no remain hungry and nakedexcept due to negligence of the rich.Who should not be stingy in spending their money on those worse off than themselves.Allah will not only take strict
      accountabillity from those people but he will also punish them accordingly.On the Day of Judgement the rich will be humiliated because they did't help the needy.The needy will complaim to Allah and say all those men on whom you graciously bestowedthe rights of wealth showed
      negligence on its proper use;they were busy spending on themselves and forgot about us.the ones who needed it.Allah will reply to him and say: "i swear on my respect and glory!I will bring you closer to me and punish them further away."
